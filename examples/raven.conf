# RavenCoin Configuration File

# To use any of the code below find 'raven.conf' and copy paste the code.
# raven.conf can be found/created by opening raven-qT, clicking Wallet at the top, then selecting Options, then clicking the button "Open Configuration File".
# For windows, file can be found/created at PATH: C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Raven
# Do not edit raven.conf while raven-qt or ravend are running.


## RPC Settings:

# RPC Username: Replace <Name> with your desired RPC username.
#rpcuser=<Name>

# RPC Password: Replace <password> with your desired RPC password.
#rpcpassword=<password>

# Allow RPC connections from localhost (127.0.0.1).
#rpcallowip=127.0.0.1

# Specify the RPC server port (default is 8766).
#rpcport=8766

# Set the maximum number of RPC connections that can be established.
#maxconnections=9000

# Specify the RPC server listen address
#rpcbind=<ip>


## Server:

# Run as a server node.*
#server=1

# Connect to specific nodes on startup, this can be done by specific IP addresses, and domains.
#addnode=<123.456.789.123>
#addnode=<example.com>

# Sets the user agent comment that the node will include when communicating with other nodes on the network. The user agent is a way for the node to identify itself to other nodes in the network. For example, the name may indicate things like the specific software version or implementation being used.
#uacomment=<name>


## Network Configuration:

# Enable DNS seeding for network peers.
#dnsseed=1:

# Manually specify nodes to connect to on startup.
#addnode=<ip>:

# Specify nodes to connect to.
#connect=<ip>: 


## Mining:

# Generate coins (mining) on this node.
#gen=0

#  Set the mining or staking address.
#miningaddress=<address>


## Indexing:

# Enable asset indexing.
#assetindex=1

# Enable transaction indexing.
#txindex=1

# Enable address indexing.
#addressindex=1

# Enable timestamp indexing.
#timestampindex=1

# Enable spent transaction output indexing.
#spentindex=1

# Reindex the blockchain on startup (useful if txindex is enabled for the first time, other than that, leave commented out. If commented in, make sure to comment out before opening again, or it force a chain sync restart)
#reindex=1


## Peer Discovery and Connection:

# Restrict the node to IPv4 only.
#ipv4only=true

# Restrict network communication to IPv4 or ipv6 only(example is ipv4).
#onlynet=ipv4

# Enable listening for incoming connections.
#listen=1


## Memory and Performance:

# Determines the max allocation of RAM (in MB, example is 5 GB) the node uses to store unconfirmed transactions that are awaiting confirmation in the mempool.
#maxmempool=5000

# Set the maximum RAM allocation (in MB, example is 5 GB) of the database cache.
#dbcache=5000

# Set the number of hours a transaction can remain in the mempool.
#mempoolexpiry=72

# Set the number of worker threads and for RPC processing.
#rpcworkqueue=555 (8 thread CPU & 32 GB RAM)
#rpcworkqueue=1100 (32 thread CPU & 64 GB RAM)
#rpcworkqueue=4200 (64 thread CPU & 128 GB RAM)
#rpcworkqueue=8000 (64 thread CPU & 256 GB RAM)

# Specifies the maximum file size (in megabytes, example is 100 GB) for the RavenCoin database. Current size as of Sept/11/2023 is about 30 GB.
#dbmaxfilesize=100000


## Firehose Tools

# Configures ZeroMQ (Zero Message Queue) to publish raw transaction data to a specific TCP endpoint and provide real-time updates about new network transactions. Applications can subscribe to this endpoint to receive notifications when new transactions are broadcasted.
#zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332

# Configures ZeroMQ (Zero Message Queue) to publish block hashes to a specific TCP endpoint and allows external applications to receive notifications whenever a new block is added to the chain.
#zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332


## Security:

# Whitelist IP addresses to allow RPC connections from specific hosts.
#whitelist=127.0.0.1

## Other Settings:

# Sets the maximum transaction fee that the wallet will pay for a single transaction.
#maxtxfee=1.0


## Notes:

# For any command above ending in "=1", 1 means enable. To disable, change the 1 to a 0, or just comment the command out by adding # at the front of the command

# * = This setting tells the RavenCoin node software to operate as a server node, which means it will actively listen for incoming network connections from other nodes. This is typically necessary if you want your node to participate in the RavenCoin network by relaying transactions and blocks to other nodes, as well as to synchronize with the blockchain. Using this command, the node will behave as a network participant and help maintain the network's functionality by sharing data with other nodes. It's an essential setting for a fully functioning RavenCoin node.
